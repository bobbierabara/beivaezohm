Alright so, I've seen some youtube vids and read some pages on google but they don't explain shit in terms of practical use. I don't care to hear about nodes and tunneling and protocols and shit. I just want a functional explanation of the differences. I use and have used proxies, both public and private so I understand how they work and what distinguishes them. I don't, however, understand the differences between different types of proxies? What are sock proxies?

Hello all. A few days ago, I accidentally left my VPN on when I tried connecting to the server. I turned it off, and when I tired to rejoin I got this again. Its been doing this ever since I tried to play. Please help. My mc username is comrade_coolio. Hello, I wonder if there's any VPN, VPS or Proxy provider that isn't blocked by Netflix for accessing the Japanese (not the US) catalog. So far I've tried setting up VPS at DigitalOcean (tokyo), Vultr (tokyo) and ConoHa and they're all banned. Is there a way I can stream through my normal connection but run other programs such as TS3, Skype, etc. through a VPN/VPS to avoid my real ip from being exposed if someone happened to get it through those programs? Please help me out, thanks. My situation is that I'm playing a game where account sharing is not allowed, and I want to avoid getting caught. I have tried to use a VPN (PIA is the one I use), but was not feasible as my latency in game was too high and inconsistent. If I want to mask my IP-address and have minimal latency, what should I be using? Any help is appreciated, thanks. gtPopular VPS/VPN has also been blocked from accessing EarnHoney as they are against the Terms of Service.

So. I have this insane idea here, not gunna use hours talking about it, but: I have on this machine and network here a unique IP address. If i use a VPN the IP will change, but will steam still be able to see that it's me who is using the same account on this machine, even tho i have a different IP with the VPN?

Hello Redditors, I'm trying to get a setup working, that I thought was relatively simple, but cannot find any instructions or guidance on the net. Perhaps it is so simple that I'm overlooking something here? I am trying to set up an anonymous connected VPS for a client who wants to be able to use Microsoft RDP for working on the server. However, the client also uses a VPN to access the internet. Their request is high security consideration, and they do not want their computer's actual. 
OPSEC is key to vending on an onion marketplace. So far everyone seems to say TailsUSB+Tor seems to be the safest method. But below I list a scenario where I believe it could possibly be compromised?

So many websites restrict my surfing on their site (I am using Amazon EC2 VPS whose servers are well-known among many other servers btw) because they know the origin of my web traffic and perhaps the IP might be used for malicious purposes in the past. Is there any way to elude this restriction (I'm assuming I get sidelined because the IP address is coming from a well-known server which is already blacklisted). Can I surf with my own hostname/ISP and maybe. This Netflix giftcard is an egift code.
