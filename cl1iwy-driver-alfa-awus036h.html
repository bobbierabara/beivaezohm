Long story. I’ve been using an Alfa WiFi AWUS036H using an Omni directional 9 dBi antenna.I think. It’s in a position where I can’t really see the model number but since it’s silver and it uses a Realtek chipset I’m pretty sure it’s the H. I’ve had it for a while and looking at upgrading.

I have a Ubuntu 14.04 4.4.0-104-generic box, and the wifi issue is killing me. Is there a wifi adapter, that will work out of the box, or at least has drivers provided by the manufacturer for this kernel? I'm from Ukraine, we have none of the thinkpenguin stuff, and I've literally been sifting through the available options trying to find a single adapter where the manufacturer has provided the drivers for kernel 4+, regardless of the price. I've already tried TP-Link TL-WN881ND, but failed. » alfa network awus036h driver » alfa network awus036h download driver » alfa network awus036h; sterowniki alfa network awus036h pobierz на UpdateStar Более ALFA AWUS036H Wireless LAN Driver and Utility.

Hey guys, So here's the story, I bought the Alfa AWUS036H wifi adapter without realising the chipset drivers aren't updated for MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan). It seems that the drivers only work for 32 bits OS and mine is a 64 bit. Anyone knows a way to make this adapter work? Would change my life on Kismac, really. Cheers.

Hello, I have just finished LFS with the basic build. I have 2 wireless cards, Intel 6300 (internal) and ALFA AWUS036H (RTL8187). Both cards are not discovered on boot. I looked at BLFS and installed wpa_supplicant-0.5.5 , wireless_tools.29 , and dhcpcd-6.11.5 (check, openssl, pciutils, blfs-bootscripts as dependencies.) The alfa AWUS036H does not have a link light. edit: The alfa card verified working on the Ubuntu system I built this LFS on. lspci sees the internal Intel NIC: 03:00.0. Alfa- awus. 03. 6h.

При использовании Alfa AWUS 036H совместно с направленной антенной при прямой видимости Драйвер Alfa AWUS036H под Windows 98/2000/XP. This question stems from another thread where /u/px403 suggested a wireless dongle with the RTL8187 chipset. Specifically the Alfa Network 1000mW High Power Wireless G 802.11g ( What other wireless units would you suggest? Does it matter if its a/b/g/n/potato? I'm sure its all about the chipset but I would like to see more options, if there are any. Other Thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/4ffz6v/fin. I cannot get my Alfa awus036h to work with gallium on my Acer cb3- 111 no matter what I try. It shows up in lsusb fine. It does not show up in when I run lshw -C network I have tried installing / making the drivers from Alfa and I get errors every time. Ideas anyone? I don't see the driver blacklisted anywhere. It works fine on other computers and with other distros. I currently have this one ( this antena connects through the USB and allows me to connect to wifi's with greater range. _Problem is_ . only Mac 10.5 Mac 10.6 are supported link ( I'm using this because I can plug it through Parallels and have it act as an external network drive I'm using windows 10, just got my alfa awus036h adapter set up with the right driver. I can get a full internet connection, but I always drop it within about a minute. It's incredibly annoying, please help. I'm running an i3 build, win10. I have been looking around and it looks as though the Alfa AWUS036H may be my best bet, but I would like assistance. Please, give me your input, good or bad, about Network adapters you have used in the past. I would like this to run in a Linux environment (currently running BT R2) so Linux driver availability is important as well. Thanks. Hi everyone. So I got a new MSI laptop and installed Kali linux onto virtual box, plugged in my alfa awus036h wifi adapter and tried to start airmon-ng. Unexpectedly I got an error about SIOCSIFFLAGS and RFKILL. rfkill list all shows there is no soft block but there is a hardware block. wut? I tried removing the rtl8187 module and reinstalling it but no change. Reinstalled the OS, no change. Used different USB ports, no change. Tried taking out the adapter while in use with kali and plugging. 
looking for a replacement for the all time classic AWUS036H which features new tech with at least N connectivity and 5ghz band for a 3 miles distant point-to-point connection over a parabolic antenna in NZ. it would be preferable if it would be fully supported by kali linux for occasional pen-testing. up until now i am considering the AWUS052NH and AWUS036ACH but i heard that the latter has very bad linux drivers it doesn't have to be an ALFA but if it should be another manufacturer Monday, earlier this week my wireless adapter abruptly stopped working and updating/installing the most recent drivers didn't solve anything. I also replaced the cord, swapped usb slots, and have done everything just shy of reformatting/upgrading OS'. I'm planning on upgrading to Win10 when I get home by using their Media Creation Tool, however my question is, is there anything I might've over looked that you guys recommend trying? If not and it I still can't get it to work on Win10 Looking for a usb wifi card that supports ad-hoc (IBSS) mode using drivers currently available in the linux kernel. I just found out my Alfa AWUS036H does not support ad-hoc mode, at least using up to kernel version 3.3. I would rather not attempt to compile drivers or kernel myself, especially as I'm trying to get this to work on a Raspberry Pi. Thanks for any advice. I am trying to use the Aircrack-ng suite on my arch laptop using an Alfa AWUS036h which uses the RTL8187 driver. I've run into the problem where no matter which channel you specify, it gets put into channel -1. Which causes it to not work. I've googled around and came up with some fixes from years ago, and they do not work for me. Anyone have any luck getting the AWUS036h to work with aircrack I will try to detail the situation: so I've recently started renting the basement floor of a house. Landlord gave me the WPA key for the wifi network, which I connect to perfectly well with: macbook pro Nexus S android phone second laptop running windows xp However, my desktops (one running Win7, other running XP) refuses to connect.

Second issue: Hi. I'm trying to get my Alfa AWUS036H working with Chrubuntu, and am having a lot of trouble. I've googled and found quite a few solutions, but none of them have worked.
